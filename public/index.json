I'm a PhD student in the Pedersen Group at Edinburgh University working on the ecology of infection and immunity in a wild mouse system. My aim is to bridge the divide between laboratory models and real-world systems by understanding the causes and consequences of ecological heterogeneity on parasite infection, host immunity, and disease control.\nThat may sound like a mouthful but I'm an ecologist at heart, passionate about all things natural. As well as ecology I'm interested in teaching and using statistical modeling in R as well as trying to work out how we can apply modern open-science practices to ecological research.\nFind out more about me and my work below or get in touch!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi - I'm Sam!
