I work on trying to understand how ecological factors affect the spread of infectious disease.

As well as ecology I'm interested in teaching and using statistical modelling in R as well as trying to work out how we can apply modern open-science practices to ecological research.\nFind out more about me and my work below or get in touch!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://www.samhillman.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi - I'm Sam!
