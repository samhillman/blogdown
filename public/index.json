I work on trying to understand how ecological factors affect the spread of infectious disease.\nI'm currently focused on how changes in resource distribution affects how animals interact, and how this changes their behaviour and diseases transmission. I use a mixture of long-term field experiments, lab studies, biologging and social network analysis, and statistical and mathematical modelling.\nThat may sound like a mouthful but I'm an ecologist at heart, passionate about all things natural. As well as ecology I'm interested in teaching and using statistical modelling in R as well as trying to work out how we can apply modern open-science practices to ecological research.\nFind out more about me and my work below or get in touch!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://www.samhillman.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi - I'm Sam!
