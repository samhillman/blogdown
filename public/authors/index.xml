      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi - I&amp;rsquo;m Sam! I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD Researcher in the Pedersen Group at Edinburgh University working on the ecology of infection and immunity in a wild mouse system. My aim is to bridge the divide between laboratory models and real-world systems by testing how ecological heterogeneity drives infection burdens, immunity and treatment success in both a wild mouse-parasite model and the same species in their natural setting to understand the causes and consequences of ecological heterogeneity on infection, immunity and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an undergraduate degree in Ecology from Cardiff University and I previously worked with Vanessa Ezenwa at the Ezenwa Lab at the University of Georgia on parasite co-infection and the effects of anthelmintic treatment on parasite community composition in a wild cotton rat system. As well as all things disease ecology, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in teaching and using R as well as how we can apply modern open-science practices in ecological research,&lt;/p&gt;
