  PhD student in the [Pedersen Group](http://pedersen.bio.ed.ac.uk/) studying the ecology of infectious diseases in wild mice. My current research is focused on how heterogeneity in resource availability affects space use, contact networks, and parasite transmission in wild mice, using a combination of field experiments and statistical and epidemiological methods.
  
  Current responsibilities include:
  
  * Extensive field trapping (non-lethal capture-mark-release) of wild mice
  * Biologging, network modelling and social network analysis of wild mice contacts
  * Statistical modelling of parasite transmission  
  
  and lots more!  
  
  See [my current field work](/project/current-work/) for more information about my current experiments or [my CV](/files/sam-hillman-cv.pdf) for a more complete picture of my background!
