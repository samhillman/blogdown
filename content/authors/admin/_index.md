Hi - I'm Sam! I'm a PhD student in the [Pedersen Group](http://pedersen.bio.ed.ac.uk/) at Edinburgh University working on the ecology of infection and immunity in a wild mouse system. My aim is to bridge the divide between laboratory models and real-world systems by understanding the causes and consequences of ecological heterogeneity on parasite infection, host immunity, and disease control.

That may sound like a mouthful but I'm an ecologist at heart, passionate about all things natural. As well as ecology I'm interested in teaching and using statistical modeling in R as well as trying to work out how we can apply modern open-science practices to ecological research.

Find out more about me and my work [below](#about) or get in [touch](#contact)!
