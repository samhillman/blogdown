Hi - I'm Sam! I'm a PhD student in the Pedersen Group at Edinburgh University working on the ecology of infection and immunity in a wild mouse system. My aim is to bridge the divide between laboratory models and real-world systems by testing how ecological heterogeneity drives infection burdens, immunity and treatment success in a wild mouse-parasite model in the lab and in their natural setting.
